Key-Handle
==========
### A hidden keyboard-input monitoring application for Windows.

This was an idea I had to familiarise myself with hooking within Windows, this program uses Win32API hooks to capture all keyboard input regardless of the active window, it will then process/format the input prior to writing it to a .txt file in the directory the program was run. **I must preface this before I go any further into demonstrating the program, I wont be held responsible for any malicious use of this program/code provided. This was just a fun hobbyist project for educational purposes in an effort to familiarise myself more with the Win32API and hooking in general.**

I'll finish the README once the program is complete...
